    Our project will involve compiling the linux kernel with different parameters (namely varying HZ), and measuring its impact on performance.
  The problem is primarily that it's not clear what degree of performance advantage is gained from this parameter, and also unclear if there's
  a noticible decline in responsiveness, OS resource management, etc. Ideally, developers of resource-constrained embedded Linux systems would
  use our results to chose the best kernel configuration for their use case, and will also use the toolchain we develop to do their own further
  investigation. We intend to provide both to our github repo.
